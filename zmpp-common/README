ZMPP Common - Common library of the ZMPP project.

Description

When implementing an interpreter for Interactive Fiction, there are
concepts and standards, that are reused across different systems.
This library was created to provide common services on the Java
Virtual Machine.
This library was extracted from the Glulx/Z-Machine versions of
ZMPP, but could be reused for other IF systems as well.

Currently this includes:

  - generic memory model
  - IFF access functions
  - support for Blorb 
  - support for Quetzal (save game abstractions)
  - support for IF metadata
