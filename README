ZMPP2 -- Second Generation Interactive Fiction Interpreter for Java

ZMPP2 is a Z-Machine and Glulx/Glk implementation in Scala. The goal
is to write a simple, efficient, flexible and reusable solution that
works in many kinds of Java VM environments, such as Java SE, Android,
Java ME and Java EE.

The second revision of ZMPP reflects current knowledge and ideas about
how I think an IF VM should look like on the Java Virtual Machine:

- Thin abstraction 
- Provide a simple, easily integratable core
- Suspend/resume execution model for maximum flexibility
- I/O responsibilities shared between core and UI
- do as much work in the core as possible
- externalizable, serializable machine state
- working on primitive values in the VM core. Yes, Java SE is
  fast, but other environments e.g. have more expensive costs for
  object allocation
- single threaded core: The VM/Glk core implementation assumes that
  it runs within a single thread. Whether the user interface employs
  multiple threads is left to the specific UI implementation.

Current features:

- Glulx 3.1.1 core almost feature complete (see known issues)
- Glk 0.7.0 almost feature complete (see known issues)
- run as applet or application (Java SE)
- runs a number of games already
- supports graphics
- multiple undo
- styles
- timer events
- file access
- complete sound support (Ogg Vorbis, MOD, AIFF through JavaSound SPIs)

Known issues:

- save/restore not implemented yet
- a handful Glk functions still missing
- no other supported Java environments yet
- the Z-Machine core in this repository is very rudimentary, 1.x is still
  the official version for Z-Machine ZMPP

  me about it through your discussions. I would not be working on this
  project without you.

  teaching me Inform and Z-Machine details
- Ruben Ortega for showing me the Kindle version of ZMPP, which inspired
  me to start a Glulx core within ZMPP
